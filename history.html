                        The idea of the project is simple to the point of insanity. The user can enter the taxi delivery address, the destination address on the site and the system will find you a car. Most often, the search takes up to a minute. When the project first started, it consisted of a single order form with the possibility of registration. There was basically nothing else. The minimum set of working functionality with which you can start making money. After the launch, other features gradually began to appear: memorizing addresses and routes, the form of additional requirements for the car (including very useful ones such as the presence of a receipt, a courier car, the presence of air conditioning, etc.), the ability to leave comments about the trips made. After a while, there was an online map with the ability to search, search for the optimal transport route, news, forum, and so on. Slowly, a simple service turns into a full-fledged multifunctional portal. BUT! At the same time, everything is rolled out as needed and only adds to the convenience of using the service.
