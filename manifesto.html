            <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
                through early and continuous delivery
                of valuable software. </li>
            <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
                development. Agile processes harness change for
                the customer's competitive advantage. </li>
            <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
                couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
                preference to the shorter timescale. </li>
            <li>Business people and developers must work
                together daily throughout the project. </li>
            <li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
                Give them the environment and support they need,
                and trust them to get the job done. </li>
            <li>The most efficient and effective method of
                conveying information to and within a development
                team is face-to-face conversation. </li>
            <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress. </li>
            <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
                The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
                to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. </li>
            <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
                and good design enhances agility. </li>
            <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
                of work not done--is essential. </li>
            <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
                emerge from self-organizing teams. </li>
            <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
                to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
                its behavior accordingly. </li>
