                <strong>What I did: (explain what you or your group did to finish your project.)</strong>
                I was engaged in the server component. More specifically, I wrote endpoints and created the database structure.

                <strong>What I found difficult: (write about any part of the project you found hard to do.)</strong>
                The hardest part is always getting started. Then everything goes smoothly.

                <strong>What really worked: (write about any part that you thought worked well).</strong>
                Endpoints worked, but then something unexpected happened.

                <strong>Next time: (write what you would do differently next time).</strong>
